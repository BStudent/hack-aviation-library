## BACKGROUND

## RESOURCES

### Aviation Hacking Challenges 
Called Bricks in the Air, in this series of four workshops, you will attempt to send messages to a mock LEGO® technic aircraft over I2C to experiment with direct injection attacks on a data bus. This year, we’ve integrated the newly released Spike Prime robot from LEGO® Education. 

For 2020, the workshops will be held in Safemode at Def Con via Twitch streams.  Checkout [dds-virtual.com](https://dds-virtual.com/) to access the workshops, otherwise, see the [github repo](https://github.com/deptofdefense/dds-at-DEFCON/blob/master/README.md) for the deets on game play for each of the work shops!
